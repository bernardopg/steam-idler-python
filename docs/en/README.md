## üöÄ Quick Start (Under 5 Minutes)

Get up and running fast with these simple steps. We'll use UV for a hassle-free Python environment.

1. **Install UV** (if you don't have it):

   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Clone the Repo & Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bernardopg/steam-idler-python.git
   cd steam-idler-python
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Set Up Configuration**:

   ```bash
   cp config_example.py config.py
   # Open config.py in your editor and add your Steam username, password, and (optional) API key
   ```

4. **Test with a Dry Run**:

   ```bash
   ./run.sh --dry-run
   ```

   This previews your setup without logging in ‚Äì great for sanity checks!

5. **Launch the Bot**:

   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

   Enter your Steam Guard code if prompted, and watch it go!

> **Pro Tip**: Grab a free Steam Web API key from [Steam's developer portal](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) to unlock advanced features like badge filtering. Without it, the bot still works but idles everything indiscriminately.

## üì¶ Requirements

- **Python**: 3.9 or higher (UV handles this for you).
- **Steam Account**: With games that support trading cards.
- **Steam Web API Key** (recommended): For library syncing and smart filtering.
- **Optional**: A dedicated Steam account to avoid disrupting your main profile.

No other dependencies ‚Äì UV takes care of the rest!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Made Easy

Customize via `config.py`, environment variables, or a `.env` file. Environment vars override file settings for flexibility.

| Setting                  | Description                                                                 | Default        |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`   | Your Steam login credentials (required).                                    | ‚Äì              |
| `STEAM_API_KEY`          | Unlocks library fetching and badge progress checks.                         | `None`         |
| `GAME_APP_IDS`           | Fallback game list if API key is missing (e.g., [570, 730] for Dota 2/CS:GO). | `[570, 730]`   |
| `FILTER_TRADING_CARDS`   | Only idle games with trading card support.                                  | `True`         |
| `FILTER_COMPLETED_CARD_DROPS` | Skip games where all cards have dropped.                               | `True`         |
| `USE_OWNED_GAMES`        | Auto-fetch your full game library via API.                                  | `True`         |
| `MAX_GAMES_TO_IDLE`      | Max simultaneous games (Steam limit: 32).                                   | `30`           |
| `LOG_LEVEL`, `LOG_FILE`  | Logging detail and optional file output.                                    | `INFO`, `None` |
| `API_TIMEOUT`, `RATE_LIMIT_DELAY` | API request timeouts and delays to avoid rate limits.              | `10`, `0.5`    |

**Examples**:

- Environment vars: `export STEAM_USERNAME=yourname STEAM_PASSWORD=yourpass`
- .env file: Create `.env` with `STEAM_USERNAME=yourname` etc., and UV loads it automatically.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Bot

Use the handy `run.sh` script or call the package directly. Here's your command toolkit:

```bash
# Preview without logging in
./run.sh --dry-run

# Full launch
./run.sh

# Ignore filters for testing (idle everything)
./run.sh --keep-completed-drops --no-trading-cards

# Limit to 10 games
./run.sh --max-games 10

# Direct UV run
uv run python -m steam_idle_bot --dry-run
```

### CLI Flags Reference

| Flag                | Purpose                                                                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--dry-run`        | Simulate and print config/games without Steam interaction.              |
| `--no-trading-cards` | Bypass card checks and use the raw game list.                          |
| `--keep-completed-drops` | Include fully farmed games.                                        |
| `--max-games N`     | Set max concurrent games.                                               |
| `--config PATH`     | Use a custom config file.                                               |
| `--no-cache`        | Disable disk caching for card data.                                     |
| `--max-checks N`    | Limit API calls for huge libraries.                                     |
| `--skip-failures`   | Quietly ignore non-critical errors during checks.                       |

Mix and match for your needs!

## üß† How It Works (Under the Hood)

1. **Library Fetch**: Grabs your owned games via Steam's API (or falls back to defaults).
2. **Card Scanning**: Checks for trading card support and caches results locally.
3. **Badge Smartness**: Queries badge progress to skip exhausted games.
4. **Secure Login**: Uses the official Steam Python client with Steam Guard handling.
5. **Idle Cycle**: Rotates games every 10 minutes in an efficient loop.

It's all powered by gevent for async efficiency and resilient HTTP sessions.

## üîê Security & Best Practices

- **Credential Safety**: `config.py` is git-ignored ‚Äì keep it local!
- **Dedicated Account**: Use a secondary Steam profile to protect your main one.
- **API Key Management**: Revoke and rotate if needed; get yours in [Steam's developer portal](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).
- **Logging**: Stick to `INFO` for normal use; bump to `DEBUG` for troubleshooting.
- **Privacy**: The bot only interacts with Steam APIs ‚Äì no data leaves your machine.

## üõü Troubleshooting

| Issue                          | Solution                                                                 |

| Login failed                   | Verify creds/2FA; check for account locks.                               |
| No games to idle               | Add API key or use `--no-trading-cards`.                                 |
| Import errors                  | Run `uv sync`; ensure Python 3.9+.                                       |
| No cards dropping              | Check filters; try `--keep-completed-drops`.                             |
